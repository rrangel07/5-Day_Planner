## Description

When the user access the site, they are presented a table with divisions for the time of the date and 15 min intervals subdivisions so they can fit in it the activities that need to remember during the day.

On the top of the page, the user will be able to see a clock with the current day, date and time.

When the time has passed and it's later than one of the time blocks, this time block's background will change color to let the user know that time has already passed.

Red for past events, yellow for current events and green for upcoming ones. The user has multiple save buttons that save all the timeblocks in local memory and also multiple erase buttons that delete only the timeblock they're embeded in.
